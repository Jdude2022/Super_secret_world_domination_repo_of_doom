# Super_secret_world_domination_repo_of_doom
Plan to take over the world, or find employment.

What we know:
1. Nothing counts unless you can get people to see it.
2. Learning in public seems effective
3. Ai and ML are taking over atm
4. Use domain knowledge if you have it.

Steps to world domination or job readyness:
  1. Social media presence. <looking at TikTok, youtube shorts, Linkdin>
  2. Advertisments to bring people to look at the project. <or to get over camera shyness>
  3. Algos <just a review>
  4. Focused work on where you want to be, and not where you "think" the world wants you.
  5. Apply domain knowledge to the work.
  6. Grammerly probably.
